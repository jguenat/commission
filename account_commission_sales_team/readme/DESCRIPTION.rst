This module extends the functionality of `account_commission` to allow you to
populate commission agents on invoice line by setting default agents on sales team.

**IMPORTANT**: Sales team agents will be added if not already present
on the invoice line. It will not remove agents set by another method. This allows
you to have sales team agents in combination with e.g. partner agents.
